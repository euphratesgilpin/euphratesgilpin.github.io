				<h2>Why is Female Content Creation so Difficult?</h2>
				<p id="sub">Article by AhRose</p>

				<p class="bt">Today, in the world of Twitch, YouTube and the internet in general, we see a lot of different creators, streamers, and consumers. It’s common knowledge that people will only consume the content that they themselves want to watch. But why does this create such a large gap between female and male content creators and their growth?</p>

				<p class="bt">After reviewing a number of articles, Quora pages and Reddit questions, it became obvious that a large number of people believe that Esports is a major factor in the growth and retention that male streamers are given. The simple fact that men are more prominent in these competitions, and have a much higher win rate, places them at the center of attention for long enough that it boosts their communities. And of course, this is a good thing. However, what I wanted to know, is why <strong>are</strong> there so few females participating in these contests? Is there discrimination to get in? Or are there simply too few girls interested in this field?</p>

				<p class="bt">On Twitch, a streaming site, there are many female streamers. However, only 35% of the entire Twitch community was female, a 2019 study found. Unbelievably, some people suggested that girls are simply worse at gaming. Why? Well, they support their claims by saying that you have to be good at something to prosper, and stick at it for a long time. These are totally valid claims, but there is little evidence to show that women are less dedicated, or practice less, if they are trying to succeed in an area of their own making. Rather, women are often seen to be more entertaining; but since men tend to take part in competitions, even those with the driest personalities gain more viewers simply for their participation.</p>

				<p class="bt">While researching, I asked myself, is it possible that there are less women streaming on Twitch because the community has driven them away? Some parts of Twitch seem to suggest that women can only grow as content creators if they class themselves as a “Gamer Girl”, and wear revealing clothing. Oftentimes, this gains many new viewers, and guys who just want to watch them for their bodies. However, this is only a portion of the girls on Twitch. Sadly, even those who don’t clickbait with their titles and bodies, are too often harassed, disrespected and trolled in their chats. They receive ugly messages and donations that can severely damage their mental health, pushing them away from doing something they love.</p>

				<p class="bt">Within the last few months, YouTuber and streamer Niki Nihachu spoke up about the pain she feels from being on the internet. She was distraught, and, through tears, she shared how cruel people had been editing her photos to make her appear naked. She felt that no one  should have to go through that kind of suffering, and I think we can all agree: the worst thing the internet can do is target you.</p>

				<p class="bt">Simply put, the internet can be a tough place for women who want to prosper. We have a choice to make; do we allow people to hurt these powerful girls, and do nothing about it? Or do we support them whenever we can, bringing them up when they’re at their lowest. All around the world, there are people working to bring equality between men and women- in the workplace, in the home, and everywhere else as well. It isn’t right that these old-fashioned boundaries still seem to apply on the internet. We have to start somewhere to change this, and if support is all we can give right now, then we should give everything we can to help.</p>
